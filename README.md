# World-Populaton-Analysis
Objective is to analyze the population in different years in various countries and their ranks, growth rate, world population percentage and top contitnents
To fit a model from machine learnig models like linear regression, kNN, random forest, decision tree to predict 2022 population depending on previous years and to predict world popultion perecentage depending on all-years population 
# Key highlights:
I have used Choropleth map to analyze growth rate and scatterplot of plotly package to analyze the area distributed depending on area density and top 10 countries with highest population.
# Conclusion:
China and India are the top 2 countries with above 1.4 billion population and Asia is the top continent among six continents and Macou Country has the greater density population covered around area of 30km^2 
**Linear regression** fits best in both the cases to predict the values which gives the best accuracy
